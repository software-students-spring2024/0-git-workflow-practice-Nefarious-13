I find this article interesting and practical on it's discussions on working with management to eventually deliver a final visual product. It's often with dealing with people that many are **vague** and **unclear**, but adapting the habit of being persistent to find a *common ground* or *goal* can be key for making visual designs.

### Comment by Edison Chen (ebc5802)
This article touches on customer frustrations and the importance of connecting with clients: a frequent problem for software engineers. I appreciate one solution the Rauwerdink presents: the willingness to kill their darlings. She recommends to "*dive into quick iterations and embrace the art of failing fast.*" This sentiment is reflected in my entrepreneurial classes. During a class called Startup Lab, I worked with a group to interview potential customer groups and build [meaningful products](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ZxnyRM0TFbSkoJMUmIBL2E-R55OH03OrFq1qqiJAMg0/edit?usp=sharing). Throughout the process, we were forced to fail fast in order to get closer to a viable business solution. As a designer or SWE, it is easy to fall in love with your product but, as you said, it's important to find common ground with your end user and design something that will add value for them.
